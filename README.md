<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Back in 2014 I started working on a cashier system. This system I developed over 6 years until 2020 which is when I realised the limits to my design. Since then I learned a lot and that's why I decided to remake the project from scratch with a more modern, secure and modular approach than the legacy version.
